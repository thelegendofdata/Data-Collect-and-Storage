# Data-Collect-and-Storage
**Project Description**

For these two datasets you now need to

import the files
study the data they contain
make sure the data types are correct
identify the top 10 neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs
make graphs: taxi companies and number of rides, top 10 neighborhoods by number of dropoffs
draw conclusions based on each graph and explain the results
